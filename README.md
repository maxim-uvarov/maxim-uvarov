# Hakuna Matata

- ðŸ¤“ Disclaimer: I started using CLI apps only in 2022, thanks to Nushell. Prior to that, I was an analyst on the MS stack (Excel + Power BI).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [numd](https://github.com/maxim-uvarov/numd), [cy](https://github.com/cyber-prophet/cy)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: English, Spanish, Nushell, Git, Claude Code, VisiData... ðŸ¤¯
- ðŸ¤” Any advice from experienced developers is always welcome! It seems to me that I often behave clumsily in many ways, but I'm keen to grow and receptive to help.
- ðŸ™ˆ I used to be a leader in large tech communities that I founded, where my opinion held value. Now, I'm a newbie in communities created by others. It is a very special experience!
