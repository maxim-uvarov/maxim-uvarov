# Hakuna Matata

- 🤓 Disclaimer: I started using CLI apps only in 2022, thanks to Nushell. Prior to that, I was an analyst on the MS stack.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Cy](https://github.com/cyber-prophet/cy)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: English, Nushell, Git, LLMs, VisiData
- 🤔 Any advice from experienced developers is always welcome! I often behave clumsily in many ways, but I'm keen to grow and receptive to help.
- 🙈 I used to be a leader in large tech communities that I founded, where my opinion held value. Now, I'm a newbie in communities created by others. It is a very special experience!
