## My Background

Back in 2010, I began my career as a search engine marketing analyst. Quite soon, I became the Head of the Paid Marketing team in a big e-commerce startup (Wikimart.ru). I was a co-founder of SEM-automation startup [K50.ru](https://k50.ru) (acquired by Yandex in 2021).

I was a founding member of big communities (each with more than 10k members) about SEM and Power BI, and served as an active moderator. Over the years, Yandex granted me the status of an educational expert, and Microsoft acknowledged me as a Most Valuable Professional (a status I held for 5 years).

I co-founded and was in charge of working with speakers at the first and biggest professional conference about Search Engine Marketing in Russia for 5 years.

Together with my co-host Maksim Zelenskiy, we have recorded more than 32 shows on Power BI in the [bi-tv](https://www.youtube.com/bitvru) series, either by ourselves or with invited exceptional professionals.

During my career, I have been a speaker at more than 70 public events on digital marketing and web analytics, primarily focusing on conversion prediction. You can find the subjects of my speeches translated by ChatGPT [here](https://github.com/maxim-uvarov/maximuvarov.ru/blob/59a949c756e5b4ccd4763918f3f45e0ec952dcb1/rocket-docs/src/docs/digest_en.mdx).

According to my RescueTime logs, I have spent more than 3.5k hours working in MS Excel and Power BI. I have even recorded commercially successful educational video courses on how to use Excel and Power BI for digital marketing analytics (Needfordata.ru).

I was a search marketing consultant for companies like Hotels.com, Mail.ru, Ozon.ru, and others undisclosed due to NDA.

I co-organized data hackathons in collaboration with Yandex, Microsoft, IT-agency, and Comagic.

As a team member, I have won prizes in big hackathons for chatbots and open data.

In 2019, I had the honor of teaching my course "Analytics of Digital Marketing" to 2 groups of students at HSE.ru (a top-ranked university in Russia).

In 2020, I decided to change my life. I stopped community activities, quit my addictions\*, and started meditating extensively using the self-inquiry technique advocated by Gary Weber and Ramana Maharshi\***.

In 2021, I moved to Bali island where I am learning, researching, and discovering applications of Cybergraph. Cybergraph is a general-purpose, permissionless, informational graph built on top of the content addressing mechanism (IPFS) and lives in the consensus computer of the Bostrom blockchain.

In 2022, a friend of mine showed me Nushell, and later I started the development of [cy](https://github.com/cyber-prophet/cy), a tool for interacting with Cybergraphs. I had never written code before, except for analytics purposes, so I became a junior developer on my own.

Since 2011, I have always been free to choose tasks for myself, and I have never selected anything that is boring to me.

Even though I don't have extensive corporate experience (and thus lack experience in working with big data and learning from experienced developers and analysts), I have invested a lot of time in improving my computer efficiency. I believe that I have valuable knowledge and insights from real-world practice to share.

\* I'm still missing my community activities and addictions as they brought me the most pleasures in my life. 

\** And related to my rudimentary community leader manners: I'm extremely grateful to the folks from the Nushell community, as they tolerate my sometimes irrelevant, selfish newbie sentiments that bypass my control. However, I must assure you that I'm really trying my best to be a useful member of the community and not flood too much.

\*** And finally, meditation is starting to give me pleasure, so hopefully one day I will forget about my previous unhealthy sources.
