## My Background

I began my career as a search engine marketing analyst, quite soon I became a Head of Paid Markeing team in a big ecommerce statup. I was a cofounder of SEM-automation startup K50.ru (acquired by Yandex).

I was a founding member of big communities about SEM and Power BI and served as an active moderator. Over the years, Yandex granted me the status of an educational expert and Microsoft the status of a Most Valuable Professional (that I was holding for 5 years). 

According to my rescuetime logs I spent more than 3.5k hours working in MS Excel and Power BI. I even recorded commercially succesful educational video courses on how to use Excel and Power BI for digital marketing analytics.

In 2020, I decided to change my life, quit my addictions, and started meditating extensively using the self-inquiry technique advocated by Gary Weber and Ramana Maharshi. 

In 2021, I moved to Bali island where I am learning, researching, and discovering applications of Cybergraph. Cybergraph is a general-purpose, permissionless, informational graph that is built on top of the content addressing mechanism (IPFS) and lives in the consensus computer of the Bostrom blockchain.

In 2022, a friend of mine showed me Nushell, and later I started the development of [cy](https://github.com/cyber-prophet/cy), a tool for interacting with Cybergraphs.

I have never had a manager who was more technically advanced than me. What I learned, I learned mostly by myself, though I would be happy to find an experienced it-mentor, that could point the direction of my development. I'm open to any advice and collaboration with professionals.

From my side, I can provide:
- Sincerity and acceptance. I don't judge, envy, or lie. I admire talent in a wide range of manifestations.
- Expertise in web analytics and optimizing paid marketing campaigns.
- Understanding of what newbies need when being taught new technology. This understanding comes not only from being a newbie myself to many well-known tools, but also from spending a significant amount of time in my SEM and Power BI communities, interacting with newbies and building mindset that help me better understand them.
- Eagerness and ability to learn new things.
